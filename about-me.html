            I am getting my bachelors degree in Computer Science at the
            University of Arkansas. I am currently a Junior with expected
            graduation date of 2022. I went to school at the American
            Cooperative School in La Paz, Bolivia.

          <h3 class="card-subtitle">My Passions</h3>
          <p class="card-paragraph">
            I am really passionate about music. I mainly play the guitar and
            electric bass but I can play some drums. I enjoy listening and
            playing all sorts of music. Checkout some of the songs I wrote in my
            music card! Additionally, I am just getting into photography. I
            might not have the best camera but I enjoy so much learning about
            lighting, tones of color, angles, and everything that makes each
            picture unique. If you want to see some of the photographs I took,
            checkout my photograph card. Finally, I really enjoy cooking! It’s a
            great way to calm down, experiment, and listen to my playlists.
            Maybe someday I’ll add a card with my very own recipes!

          <h3 class="card-subtitle">My Story</h3>
          <p class="card-paragraph">
            First of all, thanks for checking out my website! I have been
            putting a lot of effort into it but it is far from perfect. If you
            have suggestions, feedback, or simply want to say hi, send me an
            email!
          </p>
          <p class="card-paragraph">
            I think that saying that I am trying to find the meaning of life is
            quite cliché. So I have settled with making each day as productive
            and fun as I can. (If you go to my Software Engineering card and
            read my spiel about breaking down problems you will understand why I
            think this way). I believe that I have to learn something new
            everyday. If I did not learn something new today, I wasted my day.
          </p>
          <p class="card-paragraph">
            What better way to learn new stuff than a huge change in your life.
            This is one of the reasons why I came to study at the University of
            Arkansas. I was born and raised in La Paz Bolivia, I come from a
            family of four, and actually they are the persons that inspire me to
            learn something new everyday.
          </p>
          <p class="card-paragraph">
            I left La Paz just a few weeks after I turned 19 years old. After a
            flying for almost two days, I finally made it to the University of
            Arkansas. I knew already I wanted to study Computer Science because
            I was always passionate about computers. (Check out my Leadership
            card, I explain my job back home with computers). These last four
            and half semesters taught me new ways of thinking. The CSCE
            department at the University of Arkansas has the nicest people I
            have ever met. If you are not convinced that I am truly passionate
            about computers, I can give you my 45 minute talk on how
            mind-blowing it is how we turn rocks into smart phones.
          </p>
          <p class="card-paragraph">
            I have met wonderful people from all over the world. Participated in
            several clubs, and started doing new sports! Fast forward today, I
            was fortunate enough to make friends I can call asking for help and
            I know they will be there for me. I worked as a Resident Assistant
            at the University of Arkansas my Sophomore year. Unfortunately, due
            to the global COVID-19 pandemic, I had to quit my job. This was
            truly a difficult decision for me because I loved being a Resident
            Assistant. I consider myself to be an extrovert so I was always so
            excited to talk and help my residents! I enjoyed so much making
            programs, building a community, or just play ping-pong in the dorm.
            I am looking forward to what the future has prepared for me. I can’t
            wait to start working, keep learning and contribute to society.
