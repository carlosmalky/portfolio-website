          <p class="card-paragraph">
            This word frequency finder has one C++ file that uses object
            oriented programming to find the most used words in a text. This
            program uses sorting algorithms, mainly merge sort. There are two
            outputs this program produces. The first output is a .txt file that
            has all the words in the book sorted alphabetically with their
            frequency next to them. This output is called the “bookname”.txt –
            alphabetical.txt. The second output file is all the words sorted by
            their word frequency. The top word is the word that is used the most
            in the entire book. This file is outputted as “bookname”.txt –
            frequency.txt. This project is an assignment from the University of
            Arkansas and contains modified code from John Gauch.

          <h3 class="card-subtitle">Name Finder</h3>
          <p class="card-paragraph">
            This program written in C++ uses a binary search tree in order a
            name that the user asks from a database containing the 1,000 most
            popular names for boys and girls in the United States. If the name
            is not found, the program will tell the user that the name was not
            found and ask for another name to search. If the name is found, then
            it will return the name, a percentage of popularity, and the rank of
            the name. This program has code that belongs to John Gauch. This was
            a project for my Programming Foundations 2 class at the University
            of Arkansas.

          <p class="card-paragraph">
            I am currently developing personal website using HTML, CSS and
            JavaScript, learning fundamental principles of web development and
            site deployment. I Deployed website using AWS EC2 Ubuntu with NGINX
            as principal server and HTTPS handler. o Setup HTTPS for the site
            using Certbot and Let’s Encrypt.
          </p>
          <p class="card-paragraph">
            This has been a great personal project because I am learning about
            website development and getting better on working towards my
            personal goals. Developing a website has also taught me how to
            think. If you know HTML, you know DIVs work. If you don’t, let me
            explain briefly. A parent DIV is like a container. For this example,
            we have a DIV that is a lunch bag . Our goal is to fill the lunch
            bag with food! We cannot just throw pasta, an apple and juice in
            there, Each different item needs its own container. The pasta has
            its own smaller container, a child DIV! The apple can be wrapped in
            a napkin, and the juice has its own box. Each container is different
            for each item in the lunch bag. Each child DIV is different than the
            previous one. So, we started with a problem, filling the lunch bag,
            and we broke it down in smaller problems. Now you can enjoy your
            lunch! I translate this way of thinking to real-life problems,
            homework assignments, and even cooking. Ilook at the big picture
            (parent div), then break down each step there is to take (child
            divs). This is an extremely helpful skill to have because now I can
            solve problems faster, easier, and more reliably.

          <h3 class="card-subtitle">Hangman</h3>
          <p class="card-paragraph">
            The purpose of this game was to program the classic game Hangman
            using C++. I hope you have fun enjoying the game. I wrote hangman by
            first coming up with a function that prints the underscores
            equivalent for the number of letters of a word. The next function
            then is a type bool checks if the letter guessed by user is part of
            the word. The hangman figure is an array of different symbols. In
            order to find how many times can the user guess I divide the number
            of body parts by the number of body parts at position [0]. Finally,
            the program runs through several if else statements asking the user
            for new letters.

          <p class="card-paragraph">
            Play Tic Tac Toe against a friend and see who is the most skilled! A
            short but fun C++ program that I made to play tic tac toe against
            friends. In order to build the board, I used a function that would
            print the a vertical or horizontal line. The paramenter for this
            function was an array in order to assign a horizontal line at
            position [0] and vertical line at position [1] and so one. I print a
            total of 5 lines in order to make the board. To check if there is a
            winner, my program just compares the values of the array at a
            certaion location. It checks vertically, horizontally, and
            horizontally. Finally, each location on the board has a number where
            the user can place their play there.
