              Welcome! Thank you for taking the time to visit my website.
              Hopefully you will learn more about who I am as you read through
              the About Me page.

            <p class="about-info-description">
              I was born and raised in La Paz, Bolivia (Bolivia has amazing
              food, just saying). I graduated from high school May 2018 and came
              to study to the University of Arkansas August 2018. I am currently
              studying Computer Science as my undergrad with an expected
              graduation date of May 2022. You can read more about my education,
              work, and skills from my resume in my resume page.

              Coder: I have been investing a lot more time in coding. I'm
              learning new languages, doing personal projects and my own (like
              this website), and coding challenges that people give me. If you
              want to learn more about my coding, checkout my Software
              Engineering page.
