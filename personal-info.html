            Hello! My name is Carlos Malky but I usually go by my middle name,
            Akeem. I am a 20 years old and I am currently studying Computer
            Science at the University of Arkansas as my undergrad. I was born
            and raised in La Paz, Bolivia. Coming to the United States was a
            huge change but I am extremely glad I came. I learned a lot, made
            wonderful friends, and had many eye opening expiriences. Other fun
            facts about me is that I play the guitar and the electric bass. You
            can checkout some of my songs in my YouTube channel, just click on
            the button in my Home page. Other hobbies I have are drawing, riding
            my bikem, and most recently coding in my free time. Because I work
            at the University of Arkansas, they made us take a personality test.
            The two words that describe me the most based on those tests are
            futuristic and optimistic. Those two words hit spot on. As you get
            to know me, you will see why. Anyways, welcome once again!
