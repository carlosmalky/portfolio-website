          <h3 class="card-subtitle">Resident Assistant</h3>

          <p class="card-paragraph">
            I worked as a Resident Assistant at the University of Arkansas from
            August 2019 - March 2020.
          </p>

          <p class="card-paragraph">
            Some of responsibilities included maintaining a safe and welcoming
            environment for Holcombe and Futrall halls on campus. Responsibly
            monitored Holcombe and Futrall halls and report any issues to the
            campus police. Organized Global Series in Holcombe Hall to help
            spread International culture awareness on campus.
          </p>
          <p class="card-paragraph">
            My favorite part of being a Resident Assistant was to establishing
            trust and friendship with my residents so they could come to me for
            help, advice, or simple hang out.
          </p>

          <h3 class="card-subtitle">Computer Tutor</h3>
          <p class="card-paragraph">
            As a computer tutor I would teach parents from my school how to use
            the school’s email, check their students’ grades, navigate the
            school portal, and basic use of Microsoft Office. Each parent that I
            would work with had different needs so I would provide them with
            unique ways learning the software they had difficulties with. I
            would also teach parents problem-solving skills and how to not be
            afraid to explore website when searching for something specific.
          </p>
          <p class="card-paragraph">
            My favorite part was to see the parents would be scared from
            clicking too many times the mouse to confidently navigate websites.
